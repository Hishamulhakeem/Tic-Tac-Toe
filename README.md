# Tic-Tac-Toe in Java

## Description
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. The game allows two players to play against each other in a console-based environment. The program ensures smooth gameplay, checks for win conditions, and declares the winner or a draw when appropriate.

## Features
- Console-based user interface
- Two-player mode
- Board updates dynamically after each move
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Detects a draw when no more moves are possible

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Standard Input/Output

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system (JDK 8 or later).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the Java file using:
   ```sh
   javac TicTacToe.java
   ```
5. Run the program:
   ```sh
   java TicTacToe
   ```
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Game Rules
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 uses 'X', and Player 2 uses 'O'.
- Players take turns placing their mark in an empty cell.
- The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all 9 cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a GUI version using Java Swing or JavaFX.
- Add an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Improve error handling for invalid inputs.
